# Video Mosaic
This repo contains jupyter notebooks to turn a video into a video mosaic. A video mosaic is where each frame of the video is a photomosaic. Inspiration for this was taken from the Cifar100 dataset, Visual Genome dataset (https://visualgenome.org/) and a medium post describing another way to create a photomosaic (https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-build-your-mosaic-image-from-scratch-using-python-123e1934e977).

# Run
1. Download the Visual Genome dataset linked in the `database_creation.ipynb` notebook
2. Run the `data_creation.ipynb` notebook
3. Run the `video_mosaic.ipynb` notebook according to the instructions at the top of the file
